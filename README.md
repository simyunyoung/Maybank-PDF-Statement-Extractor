## How to Use (Super Simple!)

### Step 1: Prepare Your PDF Files 📁
1. **Download your Maybank statements** from online banking (PDF format)
2. **Create a folder called `Drop`** in the project directory
3. **Copy all your PDF files** into the `Drop/` folder

```
Your folder should look like:
Maybank_app/
├── Drop/                    ← Put your PDFs here!
│   ├── statement_jan.pdf
│   ├── statement_feb.pdf
│   └── statement_mar.pdf
└── maybank_parser.py
```

### Step 2: Run the Magic! ✨
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project folder and virtual environment is active
# (You should see "(venv)" in your terminal)

python maybank_parser.py
```

### Step 3: Get Your Results! 📊
The program will create two files with all your transactions:
- **`maybank_transactions.csv`** ← Open with Excel/Google Sheets
- **`maybank_transactions.json`** ← For advanced users

### 🎯 How to Know It Worked
You'll see messages like:
```
Processing: statement_jan.pdf ✓
Processing: statement_feb.pdf ✓
Processed 3 files successfully.
Total transactions extracted: 45
Saved to maybank_transactions.csv ✓
```

> **That's it!** Your messy PDF statements are now organized in a clean spreadsheet! 🎉

### 📊 What You Get
- **Clean spreadsheet** with all your transactions
- **Organized columns:** Date, Description, Amount, Type (Credit/Debit)
- **Ready to use** in Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet program
- **No more manual typing** or copy-pasting from PDFs!

## Output Format

The parser extracts the following information for each transaction:

- **date**: Standardized date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **raw_date**: Original date from PDF
- **posting_date**: When transaction was posted
- **transaction_date**: When transaction occurred
- **description**: Transaction description
- **amount**: Transaction amount
- **type**: CREDIT or DEBIT
- **source_file**: Source PDF filename
- **pattern_used**: Which regex pattern matched

## 📁 Project Structure (What Each File Does)

```

## Troubleshooting (Common Beginner Issues)

### 🚨 **"Command not found" or "Python not recognized"**
- **Solution:** Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Windows users:** Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

### 🚨 **"No such file or directory"**
- **Solution:** Make sure you're in the right folder. Use `ls` (Mac/Linux) or `dir` (Windows) to see files
- **Quick fix:** `cd path/to/Maybank_app`

### 🚨 **"No transactions extracted"**
- **Check:** Are your PDFs in the `Drop/` folder?
- **Check:** Are they actual Maybank credit card statements?
- **Try:** Open one PDF manually to make sure it contains transaction data

### 🚨 **"PyCryptodome is required"**
- **Solution:** Your PDF is password-protected. The program will handle this automatically!
- **If it fails:** Try `pip install pycryptodome` manually

### 🚨 **"Permission denied"**
- **Solution:** Close any Excel files that might be using the output files
- **Or:** Run terminal as administrator (Windows) or use `sudo` (Mac/Linux)

### 🆘 **Still stuck?**
1. **Double-check:** Python is installed (`python --version`)
2. **Make sure:** You're in the project folder (`ls` should show `maybank_parser.py`)
3. **Verify:** Virtual environment is active (you see `(venv)` in terminal)
4. **Try:** Restart terminal and repeat Step 3 from installation

> **Beginner-friendly tip:** Most issues are solved by carefully following the installation steps again!

## 💪 Confidence Boosters for Beginners

### "I'm not technical - can I really do this?"
**YES!** This tool is designed for non-programmers. Thousands of people with zero coding experience use tools like this successfully. You're just following step-by-step instructions - like following a recipe!

### "What if I break something?"
**Don't worry!** This tool only *reads* your PDF files and *creates* new spreadsheet files. It cannot:
- ❌ Modify your original PDF statements
- ❌ Access your bank account
- ❌ Send data anywhere online
- ❌ Damage your computer

### "What if it doesn't work?"
**No problem!** The worst that can happen is you get an error message. Your files are safe, and you can always:
